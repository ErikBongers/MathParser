* Use graffel parser to create c++ parser version.
* put MathParser in a c++ library (in prep of webasm)
  - API:
    - input is txt
    - output is json:
      > api call to getResultLenght()
      > api call with a buffer of the necessary lenght to get the output.
      - API:
        - bool parse(char* text) -> always returns true for now?
          > int parse() returns number of tokens.
        - int getResultLenght()
        - void getResult(char* buffer, int buflen)
  > output in json?
    > for the time being: just keep the Result-list.
  > use lib in UWP project?

* implicit mult with power: precedence changes depending on order?
  > 2^3b  =  2^(3b) >> mult has prio
  > 2b^3  =  2(b^3) >> power has prio

Nice to have
---------------
* custom functions
* resolve equations
* units : nest them with operators
* simplify
* plotting
* Latex visualisation
