Nice to have

        Timepoints
Time_point<utc_clock> now = …;
Now():
Std:chrono::steady_clock::now() -> time_point<steady_clock>
Std:chrono::utc_clock::now() -> time_point<utc_clock>

Duration
Duration = now() - then();
Durations allow calculations and max(), floor(),…
Floor is template: floor<Sec>(duration);

See duration doc for conversions with or without precision loss, float or int.
Duration_cast<hours> from_duration to_duration: so, duration are of a type? Probably not. Cast is needed for durations of INT type. The cast defines the resolution, I guess.
Duration without cast: duration<double, millis>
So, I guess for a duration<int, sec> a duration_cast<sec> is needed?

* Implicit variable:
    Implicit var _ always contains the last result (being the result of the previous statement)
    10+20+30;
    +40: //add to the result of the previous line.
    But what if:
    A=10;
    +20;//add this to A or only to implicit var or error? -> no error. Add to Implicit result.
    B=50;
    +=30; //add to var of previous line.
    +=40;// continue adding…

    C=_; //underscore is implicit var. Assign last value to C, which is B in this case;
    70;
    D=_;//D = 70

* custom functions
* resolve equations
* Variable ranges and wildcards
    Sum(a..z) : // sum all vars a to z
    Sum(a*); sum all vars that start with a; -> ambiguous syntax
    Sum([a*]);
    Ranges: always use [] ?
    Allow both (a..z) and ([a..z])

* simplify
* Latex visualisation

Unit and var with same name:
F=123;
33F; >>> alleen in dit geval warning ambiguous. Wat is oplossing? 33.F ?
33C.F; >> not ambiguous !

Math Parser allows arithmetic expressions in a C-style format:
** Basic syntax
//this is a comment line
a=3+4;
b=2a+3; //implicit multiplication is allowed.
a+=2; b /= a;

** Output control
a=1; //
!b=5/6; // -> echo the code in addition to the result
!//echo this comment line

#c=sin(30deg); //suppress output, but still execute the code.
!#d=a+b; //echo the code…but suppress the result
/# //suppress output for the next 4 lines.
a+=1;
a+=3;
a+=PI;
a+=7;
#/
a;

** Units
Distance=10km+1mi;
Imperial=Distance.mi;
Result=(Imperial+5m).km;
Hot=1000K.C.F; //Conversion from K to C to F. Intermediate conversion to C is pointless.
Hot=Hot.C; //set new unit for variable Hot
Implemented units:
Length:
Temperature:
…
** Basic expr:
Expression without assignment:
5*7;

** Functions
Trigonometry: sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan
Other: max, min(????), round, abs;
Alternative for abs: |x|
< change Function to have a min and a max no of args.
