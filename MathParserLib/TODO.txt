* error in func arguments not passed through.
  > don't bother: first implement multiple args?
* save last statement in localStorage.
* add line and pos to errors.
* implicit mult with power: precedence changes depending on order?
  > 2^3b  =  2^(3b) >> mult has prio
  > 2b^3  =  2(b^3) >> power has prio

Nice to have
---------------
* custom functions
* resolve equations
* units : nest them with operators
  > m, km, cm, mm,...
  > conversion?
    x = 10m; //what if m is defined as var (m=mass)? Warning would be annoying...but will only display for implicit mult! So...warning is ok?
    y = (cm)x; //probably not this notation.
    y = x.cm;
    y = y.cm;
    y = (10km).cm;
